[![Build Status](https://github.com/CultureHQ/add-to-calendar/workflows/Main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CultureHQ/add-to-calendar/actions)
[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@culturehq/add-to-calendar.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@culturehq/add-to-calendar)

A small package for adding an event to a calendar.

## Getting started

First, add `@culturehq/add-to-calendar` to your `package.json` `dependencies`, then install using either `npm install` or `yarn install`. Next, you can add the component through:

```javascript
<AddToCalendar
  event={{
    name: "Happy Hour",
    details: "Let's go after work",
    location: "Boston, MA",
    startsAt: "2018-12-06T17:00:00-05:00",
    endsAt: "2018-12-06T18:00:00-05:00"
  }}
/>
```

To get the styles, be sure it import `@culturehq/add-to-calendar/dist/styles.css` into your application. You can style it appropriately for your app by overriding the CSS classes used internally. They are listed in [`styles.css`](src/styles.css).

### `children`

The label for the button that triggers the dropdown. Defaults to `"Add to My Calendar"`.

### `event`

Should be an object representing the event to be added to the various calendars. The keys are:

- `name` - the name of the event
- `details` - the details of the event
- `location` - the location of the event
- `startsAt` - the start time of the event, formatted as an ISO string
- `endsAt` - the end time of the event, formatted as an ISO string

### `open`

Defaults to `false`. Whether or not the dropdown should start open. (Will be ignored after initial render.)

### `filename`

Used to specify the name of the downloaded iCalendar file (where applicable - Apple Calendar, Outlook). Defaults to `"download"`. 

### `showIcon`

Used to control whether you want to show the calendar Icon or not. Defaults to `true`. 

### `handleClick`

Used to control the onClick event of the button if you want to extend or control it's behaviour. Be default it uses the internal function to control the dropdown. if you want to override it, provide a function `(event: React.MouseEvent, onToggle: OpenStateToggle)`  where it should expect the first argument to be the click event and the second argument the original behaviour to control the dropdown.
## Development

You can run the tests by running `yarn test` and lint by running `yarn lint`. You can run the local server by running `yarn start` which will start the docs server on `http://localhost:8080`.
